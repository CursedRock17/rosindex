# VCS repos file listing all non-package specific
# documentation repositories. Its file format, however,
# has been extended to include, on a per repository basis,
# the following extra fields:
#
# - 'short_description': A description to be used to refer
#                        to the content of the repository
#                        as a whole, e.g. ROS Install
#                        Instructions.
#
# These extra fields will be ignored by VCS upon repo importation.
