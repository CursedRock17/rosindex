title: "ROS(dep) Index"

[rosdep](http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosdep/html/) is a powerful
bootstrapping tool and is the foundation of the ROS and Catkin package
dependency system. One of the big challenges preventing ROS from being used on
more operating systems is satisfying the broad spectrum of open source
software programs and libraries, and rosdep is the Rosetta Stone of these system
dependencies.

For example, if a package has a dependency on the key `libogre-dev` then the
[libogre-dev rosdep page](http://rosindex.github.io/d/libogre-dev/) will show
not only on which versions of which operating systems `libogre-dev` can be
found, but also which versions of `libogre-dev` would be installed in each
case.

ROS Index now lists all known rosdep keys and their supported platforms in the
[System Dependencies](http://rosindex.github.io/deps/) index, and soon packages
which depend on a given rosdep key will link directly to their respective pages.

To contribute missing *rosdep rules* see the [official rosdep
documentation](http://docs.ros.org/independent/api/rosdep/html/contributing_rules.html).
