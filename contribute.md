# Contribute

There are numerous ways to contribute to ROS Index, either by adding packages,
contributing documentation to existing packages, or adding more analytics to
the website itself.

## Adding ROS Packages

The majority of repositories listed on ROS Index are discovered via the
`rosdistro` system. As such, the easiest way to add a repository to ROS Index
is to add it to `rosdistro`. While `rosdistro` is used to index distributed
packages, it is also used to automatically create API documentation for source
packages. Note that there is no presumed contract or implied maintainance
responsibility if you add your repository to `rosdistro`.

### Adding a Repository to rosdistro

If you would like you get your code indexed for documentation, click the
button below.

### Adding a Fork of an Existing Repository

If you would like you get your fork of an existing repository indexed for
documentation, click the button below.

### Releasing Binary Packages

Releasing a package for binary distribution is a bit more complicated, and
cannot be done through a web interface. It will, however, make it much
easier for users to run your code. In order to release your repository's
packages, follow the tutorials for the [bloom release automation
tool](http://wiki.ros.org/bloom) on the ROS.org Wiki.

## Adding ROS Index Metadata

In addition to standard `README` formats, ROS Index also inspects ROS package
manifest XML files for ROS Index-specific `<export>` tags in order to read
additional metadata.

See [ROS Index Metadata](/contribute/metadata) for documentation on these tags.

## Contributing Content to Packages Maintained by Others

There are many documented ROS repositories and packages out there, but
there are even more which lack descriptions or even `README` files. One of
the best ways to contribute to ROS Index is to contribute documentation to
the indexed packages directly. 

For example, if you find a package without a good description or `README`,
it's very easy to write up your own notes, and submit them as a <em>pull
request</em> on GitHub or BitBucket. 

For packages which are hosted on systems that don't support pull requests, or
packages which are no longer maintained, feel free to fork those packages on
GitHub, add documentation, and get them indexed as forks (see above for
contributing a fork).

See [Resurrecting Packages](/contribute/resurrect) for documentation on how to
bring a package back from the dead.
## Opting out of Indexing

If you do not want a branch of your repository to be shown on ROS Index, simply
create a file called `.rosindex_ignore` at the root of the repository in that
branch:

```bash
touch .rosindex_ignore
```

If you do not want a single package in a repository indexed, you can create
a `.rosindex_ignore` file at the root of that package. If this does not work or
you want some other information removed from ROS Index, please [create an issue
on GitHub](https://github.com/rosindex/rosindex.github.io/issues/new?title=%5BREMOVAL%20REQUEST%5D%20)
describing what you would like removed.

## Contribute to the ROS Index Website

ROS Index is a statically-generated website which is stored and hosted
entirely on GitHub. The website uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) framework with some custom plugins
for cloning and scraping known ROS repositories. Since it uses custom
plugins, and generation is space- and computationally-expensive, it needs
to be generated offline, and then uploaded to GitHub's severs.

Since the ROS Index website is completely open-source, issues, feature
requests, and especially pull requests are welcome.

## Fund ROS Index Development

ROS Index is a community-driven project and is not directly funded
by any grant or organization. If you're interested in supporting implementing new features or 
fixing specific bugs, but would rather contribute funds than modify the code yourself,
don't hesitate to donate or pledge bounties on
[BountySource](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/rosindex/issues).
