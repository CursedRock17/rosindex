# About

ROS Index aims to be the *definitive index* of all ROS software. It aims to do this
not only by indexing all known ROS packages listed in
[rosdistro](http://github.com/ros/rosdistro), but also include relevant forks
of known ROS packages, and encourage people to get their packages added to the
index *no matter how volatile or buggy they are*.

ROS Index also aims to better summarize the pulse of the ROS development
community with [statistics](/stats/) and the ability to list the [most recently
updated ROS repositories](/packages/page/1/time/).

For more information see:

* [Design](/about/design)
* [Development](/about/development)

See [rosindex on GitHub](https://github.com/rosindex/rosindex.github.io) for
active development.
