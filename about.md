# About

ROS Index aims to be the *definitive index* of all ROS software. It aims to do this
not only by indexing all known ROS packages listed in
[rosdistro](http://github.com/ros/rosdistro), but also include relevant forks
of known ROS packages, and encourage people to get their packages added to the
index *no matter how volatile or buggy they are*.

ROS Index also aims to better summarize the pulse of the ROS development
community with [statistics](/stats/) and the ability to list the [most recently
updated ROS repositories](/packages/page/1/time/).

For more information see:

* [Design](/about/design)
* [Development](/about/development)

See [rosindex on GitHub](https://github.com/rosindex/rosindex.github.io) for
active development.

# Funding

ROS Index is a community-driven project and is not directly funded
by any grant or organization. If you're interested in supporting implementing new features or 
fixing specific bugs, but would rather contribute funds than modify the code yourself,
don't hesitate to donate or pledge bounties on
